          <p>Search bars are a staple of the digital experience. Whether you're looking for a specific video, tracking down a specific social media profile or looking for a perfect article, search bars help guide us to exactly what we're looking for. But while the core function is the same, each platform approaches this tool differently, and unfortunately not all websites do it well. As I dove deeper into the user experience of search bars. I realized a critical truth: </p>
            <blockquote><i><b>Search bars are only effective if they are usable and accessible</b></i></blockquote>
          <p style="margin-top: 30px">Without these qualities, even the most beautifully designed search tool will fail to reach it's full potential. I set out to explore this phenomenon across different applications, aiming to understand how inconsistencies in their designs might impact users. The objective was clear: identify common pain points and recommend a redesign that could enhance usability and accessiblity for all users. </p>
          <b><p style="margin-top: 30px;">More specifically, thoughout the duration of this case study I:</p></b>
          <ol>
            <li>Analyzed the input and output states of search bars across three applications</li>
            <li>Selected one of the three aforermentioned applications and created state models for both mouse and keyboard users</li>
            <li>Created a redesigned search bar that addresses some of the inconsistencies I noticed during the analyses</li>
            <li>Created a state model for the redesigned component</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Input Analysis</h2>
          <p> 
            When proposing a search bar redesign, it's crucial to understand how users interact with it in the first place. This means examinign how search bars are implemented across different platforms, especially in terms of user input methods. 
          To begin, I focused on the search bars of three different applications: <b>Google Chrome, EdStem, and TikTok</b>.</p>

          <p style="margin-top: 30px"> To better understand each platform's approach, I captured key interactions with their search bars in different states. The slideshows included below highlight different design choices across Google Chrome, TikTok and EdStem.</p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 45px"><b>INSERT SLIDESHOWS HERE</b></p>

          <p style="margin-top: 30px">Beyond the screenshots included above, I noticed some key differences in the inputs of each search bar. I have summarized these differences in the table below: </p>

        <h2>State Models</h2>
        <p>To deepen my understanding of a search bar's interactions and accessibility, I created two state models that reflects the behavior I observed in the example applications. These models - one for <b>mouse users</b> and another for <b>keyboard users</b> helped me identify and analyze the different states that users move through when using search bars as well as the states I needed to anticipate in my redesign. </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">After reflecting on the difference I noticed during the input and output analyses of search bar implementations across Google Chrome, TikTok and Edstem, as well as completing the state models above, I noticed the following pressing issues in current search bar applications:
        <ul>
            <li>The rest of the page darkens when the search bar is active.</li>
            <li>Either trending or relevant searches reappear when the user clicks into the search bar after the user already used the search bar</li>
            <li>The search bar returns to an identical active state after being used</li>
            <li>When focused a light border appears around the edges of the search bar</li>
            <li>Pressing the Space or Enter key or switches the search bar to the Active state</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I combined these results into the revised state models shown below.</p>

        <i><h3>INSERT SLIDESHOW HERE</h3></i>

        <h3>Redesign #2: Adding Outline When in Focus</h3>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The search bars I observed were most usable when they clearly showed the focus states, populated results as the user types and dimmed the background to help users concentrate. 
          I incorporates these elements into my redesign to reduce distractions and make the search experience more intuitive. However, I initially, overlooked screen reader accessibility; 
          to address this, I would add aria-labels and ensure that dynamic suggestions are announced and navigable. 

          My redesign solves a mismatch by not assuming prior knowledge of the interface, unlike Chrome's current interface which can confuse first-time users with redundant icons and unclear interactions. 
          Simplifying the interface and emphasizing the active state of the search bar helps users focus on input rather than the rest of the page's contents. Inaccessaible inputs like missing focus indicators 
          or inconsistent keyboard navigation can significantly hinder users with visual or motor impairments. For exapmle, TikTok's interface is difficult to navigate with a keyboard but easy with a mouse, exemplifying 
          how non-mouse users are often deprioritized in component design. Overall, mouse and touch users are prioritized, which can exclude users that rely on keyboards or assistive technologies.
