          <p> The marching arts is a world that is ruled by performers ability to utilize visual appealing performances to communicate a message to an audience. To pull off such shows, many of the elite ensembles worldwide turn to specific companies because they are known to provide the best equipment to groups at the top of the activity.
            For Color Guard, <b>Designs By King</b> has proven to be a supplier of champions. Within the past two Winter Guard International seasons, nearly every single Independent World Class Finalist has proudly spun their rifles and sabres. Despite this dominanace, however, the website where performers go to either learn more about their products or purchase their own, leaves more to be desired. For reference, a screenshot of the webpage is included below <h3>INSERT SLIDESHOW HERE</h3> </p>

          <p style="margin-top: 30px"> In the following case study I propose a potential redesign of the Designs by King product page that aims to match it's interface to what a member of the marching arts community would expect from its most popular weapons manufacturer. More specifically I: </p>

        <h2>Current Problems</h2>
        <p>Before attempting to redeisng an Product page, it is important to first fully grasp it's existing issues. I had used Designs by Kings' product page, <b> years ago </b> and remember experiencing difficulty navigating the site. 
        Returning the webpage after many years, I noticed that some of the issues I noticed long ago were still present, along with new ones evidenced by interacting with the interface on multiple devices, with different screen sizes. 
        I summarized my main comments of the current of the website in the table below. </p>



        <table>

              <td>Category</td>

                <ul>
                  <li>The user would expect the Home Page and Product page to be different. currently, clicking the Home Tab just makes a video appear with the Product Page in the background</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>

              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>The webpage is missing alternative text for its images</li>
                  <li>The page is not visually appealing and has many instances of hard to read text due to background images</li>
                  <li>The webpage is not responsive to different screen sizes</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>In summary, the Product Page of the Designs by King website is fairly usable for any person with a background in color guard or the marching arts. Similarly, the website makes it evident to the which components are interactive and is fairly memorable due to the clear labeling throughout the page. 
          However, the current design could easily confuse a user, specifically regarding the difference between the Home and the Product page. Similarly, it could greatly benefit from a visual redesign that makes it clear to the reader what website they are on. Lastly, the existing website is not responsive, so my redesign must account for that as well.  </p>

        <h2>Design Guide</h2>
        <p>After futher usage of the Designs by King website, I developed the following visual design guide to help inform my final redesign. The guide shows my proposed color pallette for the website, the new logo, 
          suggested typography and interactive components that I plan on using in my design. When devloping this guide, I primarily focused on providing a cleaner interface while still allowing certain components such as the hoverable buttons and customer photos to remain at the forefront of the webpage.

      </section>

      <section id="mockups">
        <h2>Mockups</h2>
        <p>With my Visual Style Guide created, I then created three Mockups on Figma, each for a different size screen. To ensure continuity amongst the three designs I kept similar placement for components such as the hoverable buttons, the carousel of images and the new logo at the top of the screen.</p>
        <h3>INSERT SLIDESHOW HERE</h3>
        <p>Along with these initial mockups, I created annotated versions as well detailing specific documentation needed to replicate my designs. </p>
        <h3>INSERT SLIDESHOW HERE</h3>

        <p>
          I presented these preliminary designs to my peers for critique, where I mainly received feedback on the purpose of the double identical navigation elements. With this feedback in mind, I 
          altered my designs accordingly before coming up with the finalized version.
        </p>

      <section id="redesign">
        <h2>Webpage Redesign</h2>
        <p>I took the notes from my peers and created a webpage for my redesign of the Designs By King Product Page using HTML, CSS and Javascript, which can be found here: <b>INSERT LINK HERE</b>
        . As mentioned above, my main goal for this redesign was to improve the visual appeal of the website and improve it's responsiveness for different screen sizes. Throught the changes made on the interface and experimenting with viewing the webpage on various screens, I believe these goals have been achieved. A side by side comparison of the original and redesigned page can be found below. </p>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The redesigned version of the Designs by King Product Page provides a more visually appealing experience for the user and allows for easier navigation on more smaller screens. Though many changes have been made to the looks of the website, certain details, such as the inclusion of customer photos and images of 
          offered products are still present. Through this redesign, I was able to build valuable skills in designing webpages using CSS and HTML, more specifically how to allocate certain visual aspects to specific screen dimensions. Through doing so, I hoped to make this portion of the Designs by King webapge more usuable, helping consumers find the high quality products they need with ease.
